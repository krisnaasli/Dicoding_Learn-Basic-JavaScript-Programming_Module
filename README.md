#### * Coding Quiz: Module (main.js, Tiger.js, Wolf.js)
This program consists of three JavaScript files: main.js, Tiger.js, and Wolf.js.
The purpose of this program is to create Tiger and Wolf classes that have a strength property and growl() and howl() methods, with the strength property randomly initialized when the object is created, then use those classes in the fight() function in main.js to compare the strength between the tiger and the wolf, and export the fight result along with the objects involved.
So, this program is a JavaScript project that consists of three files: main.js, Tiger.js, and Wolf.js. 
Tiger.js and Wolf.js contain class definitions for the tiger and wolf and their methods, while main.js imports those classes, uses them to perform the fight, and exports the results.
